GTVPIPButtonOverride
==================

This app overrides the PIP intent on Google TV (corresponding to Honeycomb variants), which is also called by the button on the remote control. Installing this allows the PIP button on the remote to be overridden. This also adds a shortcut in the app launcher to directly launch the PIP activity.
